# HPC ABM

This is a model of scientists deciding how to submit jobs to a university
HPC, based on a social dilemma posed by the unpredictability of computing
jobs generally, but the predictability of some jobs.

  * If I over-estimate resources I need, I am more likely to get publishable results.
  * If I under-estimate, my results are unpublishable
  * If everyone over-estimates, then I will have to wait longer before getting my results

Then there is the general point that if I publish my results, I am more likely to get follow-on funding.
